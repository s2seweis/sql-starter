# React Frontend for User Management

This repository contains the frontend code for a user management application built with React. The application communicates with a backend server to handle POST and GET requests for managing user data. Below are instructions on how to set up and run the frontend application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-user-management.git
   cd react-user-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the backend API URL. For example:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

   Replace `http://localhost:5000` with the actual URL where your backend server is running.

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Making POST and GET Requests

In this application, there are components for making POST and GET requests to the backend routes.

- To make a POST request to create a new user, fill out the user details form and click the "Submit" button. The data will be sent to the `/users` route on the backend.
  
- To make a GET request to retrieve users, navigate to the Users page and click the "Load Users" button. The application will send a GET request to the `/users` route on the backend and display the list of users.

## Folder Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - **`components/`**: Contains React components for different sections of the application.
  - **`services/`**: Contains service files for making API requests.
  - **`App.js`**: Main component where routes and components are defined.
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point of the React application.

## Additional Information

- This project uses React Router for navigation. You can modify the routes in the `App.js` file.
- Ensure the backend server is running and properly configured to handle requests from the frontend application.

Feel free to modify and extend the code according to your requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the documentation or seek help from the community.
